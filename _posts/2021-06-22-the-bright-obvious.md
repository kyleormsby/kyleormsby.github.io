I recently ported my academic website to [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) and upgraded it to run on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template. That means I can now host my blog here, so I'll no longer be (erratically and irregularly) adding to my Wordpress blog, [The Bright Obvious](https://thebrightobvious.wordpress.com/).

The title of my new blog is $\frac{\text{mind}}{\text{matter}}$, a nod to notational puns and my desire to continue writing about academic and physical activities – the Life of the Embodied Mind.  Below, I've created an index of my old Bright Obvious posts, reverse chronologically organized according to this duality.

## mind
* [When something is nothing](https://thebrightobvious.wordpress.com/2017/06/03/when-something-is-nothing/). Informal report on my paper [Vanishing is stable motivic homotopy sheaves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04744).
* [Comparing $G$-sets and quadratic forms](https://thebrightobvious.wordpress.com/2016/02/08/comparing-g-sets-and-quadratic-forms/). Informal report on my student Ricardo Rojas-Echenique's paper [Injectivity and surjectivity of the Dress map](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01010).
* [The homogeneous spectrum of Milnor-Witt $K$-theory](https://thebrightobvious.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/the-homogeneous-spectrum-of-milnor-witt-k-theory/). Informal report on my student Riley Thornton's [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08499) by the same name.
* [Generalizing the fundamental theorem of Galois theory](https://thebrightobvious.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/generalizing-the-fundamental-theorem-of-galois-theory/). Informal report on my paper [Galois equivariance and stable motivic homotopy theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4728).
* [Until the bright obvious stands motionless in cold](https://thebrightobvious.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/until-the-bright-obvious-stands-motionless-in-cold/). My first blog post, explaining how Wallace Stevens inspired the title of my old blog.
