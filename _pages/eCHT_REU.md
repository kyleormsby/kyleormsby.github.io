The 2023 [eCHT REU](https://s.wayne.edu/echt/reu-2023/) is an online Research Experience for Undergraduates supported by the NSF and led by [Kyle Ormsby](https://kyleormsby.github.io) and [Christy Hazel](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~chazel/) (with assistance from [Scotty Tilton](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~stilton/)). Between June 12 and July 21, we will be researching problems in *homotopical combinatorics*, a field that studies the abstract homotopy theory of small categories.

Below you can find our [schedule](#schedule), a list of [resources](#resources) for the program, and a [problem list](#problems). Further information (including Zoom and Jamboard links) is available to participants on [our Zulip channel](https://echt-reu-23.zulipchat.com/).

## schedule

## problems
Some open problems in homotopical combinatorics and transfer systems:

1. Explore the combinatorics of the recursive $\odot$ construction of transfer systems presented in [BMO22a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06992) for new families of lattices/groups. Start with rectangular and Boolean lattices.
2. Enumerate compatible pairs of transfer systems (in the sense of [Cha22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05555) and [HML23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11250)) for new families of groups. Use this information to further explore the structure of bi-incomplete Tambara functors [BH22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10521).
3. Employ catalytic generating function methods and the recurrences of [BMO22a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06992) to determine a closed formula for the number of transfer systems on dihedral groups of order $2p^n$ and cyclic groups of order $qp^n$. Once closed formulas are in hand, seek bijective correspondences with known structures.
4. After identifying the lattice of transfer systems for any Abelian group $A$, follow the methods of [BOOR23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07803) and [BMO22b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03454) to enumerate premodel structures, composition closed premodel structures, and Quillen model structures on Sub($A$).
5. Building off of [Rub21b](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08723), begin to understand the relationship between saturated transfer systems and linear isometries operads for non-cyclic groups.
6. Leveraging recent work on the structure of transfer systems, extend the work of [Hil19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03017) to better understand the effect of various localizations on equivariant commutativity.
7. Explore the duality on transfer systems discovered by [FOOQW22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04415), extending it to non-Abelian groups and lifting it to operads.
8. Following [BK11](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1691), understand the relationship between model structures on posets, relative posets, cofibrant objects in **RelCat**, and $(\infty,1)$-categories. Can we use model structures on posets to compute morphisms in certain $\infty$-categories?
