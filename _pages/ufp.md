---

The 2021 [PCMI Undergraduate Faculty Program](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/programs/pcmi-2021-undergraduate-faculty-program) is allied with the motivic homotopy [Graduate Summer School](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/2021-graduate-summer-school-course-descriptions) and [Undergraduate Summer School](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/programs/pcmi-2021-undergraduate-summer-school). We will discuss _Milnor forms_ (aka motivic or $\mathbb{A}^1$-Milnor numbers), which generalize classical [Milnor numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnor_number). Participants should finish the week prepared to conduct independent and student research on this topic. We will also discuss the theory and practice of leading undergraduate research projects.

Below you can find the UFP [schedule](#schedule) (including descriptions of activities) and a list of [resources](#resources) for the program. Scroll to the bottom of [this page](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/pcmi-2021-summer-session) to see PCMI's code of conduct (to which we will adhere).

## schedule
<sub>All times US Mountain Daylight ([UTC-06:00](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc-6)). All events will occur virtually at [pcmi2021.sococo.com](https://pcmi2021.sococo.com/) on the Undergraduate Faculty Program floor.</sub>

<details>
  <summary>Tech check-in</summary>

  Optional. Stop by to test you technology setup and familiarize yourself with our meeting space at <a href="https://pcmi2021.sococo.com/">pcmi2021.sococo.com</a>.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Welcome & introductions</summary>

  Brief opening remarks and a chance to introduce yourself and meet the other participants.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Lecture</summary>

  Series of 90-minute interactive lectures developing the classical theory of Milnor numbers (of curve and hypersurface singularities), quadratic forms and the Grothendieck-Witt ring, (local) motivic degree and the Eisenbud-Levine/Khimshiashvilli form, Milnor forms, and open problems focused on the behavior of Milnor forms under blowup. The lectures should prepare participants to engage with exercises and ultimately explore open problems individually or through undergraduate research programs.

<details>
  <summary>Lunch</summary>

  Feel free to log off and have lunch on your own, or stop by the sococo Gathering Space to socialize with participants.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Discussion / problem session</summary>

  These 60-minute sessions will permit a flexible mix of discussion with the lecturer and individual and group work on exercises.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Undergraduate research (UR) discussion</summary>

  Facilitated group discussions about how to lead and mentor undergraduate research. Topics covered will include selection of research problems, program design and group dynamics, funding and recruiting, and communication of results. Some required readings from <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/clrm-63"><i>A mathematician's practical guide to mentoring undergraduate research</i></a> will help guide our discussions, so make sure you get a copy!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Peer collaboration</summary>

  Optional. Those interested in and available to continue mathematical and mentoring discussions will be divided into teams that can meet during these times.
