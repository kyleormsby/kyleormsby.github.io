Welcome! I am a visiting associate professor of [mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/) at [UW](https://www.washington.edu/) and associate professor of [mathematics](https://www.reed.edu/math/) at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/). My [research](/research/) lies at the interface of homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. This year I am teaching [Math 224](/224/) (multivariable caculus) in the winter and [Math 583B](/583/) (topological data analysis) in the spring, continuing my pure mathematics research, and applying topological and geometric methods to neuroimaging data with [NACC](https://naccdata.org/). You can access my past teaching materials [here](/teaching/). This site also contains [my blog](/blog/). Here is my [CV](/files/cv_ormsby.pdf), updated November 2023.

I believe that all of us have the ability and right to take joy in mathematics. [Everybody counts](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf).
