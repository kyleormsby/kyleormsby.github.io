Welcome! I am an associate professor of mathematics at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/); I also chair the [Department of Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.reed.edu/math-stats/). My [research](/research/) lies at the interface of homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. This year I am teaching [Math 111 (calculus)](/111/) in the fall, and [Math 113 (discrete structures)](/113/) and [Math 342 (topology)](/math342spring26/course/frontmatter.html) in the spring. You can access my past teaching materials [here](/teaching/). This site also contains [my blog](/blog/), and here is my [CV](/files/ormsby-cv-2026.pdf), updated February 2026.

I believe that all of us have the ability and right to take joy in mathematics. [Everybody counts](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf).
