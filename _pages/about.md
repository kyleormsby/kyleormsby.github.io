Welcome! I am an associate professor of [mathematics](https://www.reed.edu/math/) at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/); I also chair the department. My [research](/research/) lies at the interface of homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. This year I am teaching Math 201 (linear algebra) in the fall, Math 113 (discrete structures) and Math 442 (algebraic topology) in the spring, continuing my pure mathematics research, and applying topological and geometric methods to neuroimaging data with [NACC](https://naccdata.org/). You can access my past teaching materials [here](/teaching/). This site also contains [my blog](/blog/), and here is my [CV](/files/cv_ormsby.pdf), updated August 2024.

I believe that all of us have the ability and right to take joy in mathematics. [Everybody counts](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf).
