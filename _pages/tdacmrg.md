**what**: Summer research program on symmetry detection and topological data analysis (TDA)

**when**: 5 June - 28 July

**where**: Reed College (in-person and hybrid remote)

**who**: Two or three Reed undergrads working under the mentorship of Kyle Ormsby and Angélica Osorno

**why**: Symmetry detection is an important problem in image processing and computer vision. TDA (especially persistent cohomology) supplies a novel and effective tool for identifying symmetries in natural and artificial images. Participants will contribute to this emerging field and gain skills in
  - pure and applied algebraic topology,
  - mathematical programming, and
  - mathematics and computer science research and communication.

**how**: Continuing and graduating Reed students can apply via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXjjO3ZbwezBf1KyrV8yw2idupg7_K2OjvpXIUuj-UxWSHRQ/viewform?usp=sharing). (Apply by 15 February for full consideration.) The personal statement should consist of at most one page of English prose including:
  - Your relevant background and experience, including prior research, mathematics projects, **coding experience** (especially Python), linear algebra (required) and topology (optional) background, or mathematics-related jobs.
  - Your reasons for interest in the program.
  - Your professional goals.
  
Your faculty reference **does not** need to prepare a letter of recommendation.

Please contact Kyle Ormsby (ormsbyk@reed.edu) or Angélica Osorno (aosorno@reed.edu) with any questions.
